// Pure helpers for the To Do widget's LOCAL storage mode ([S-41]). Local tasks

// touches Tauri, IPC, or accounts, and every rule below is unit-tested.
//
// The stored shape is deliberately lean: an account task carries importance /
// due-date / list metadata a local task has no source for, so we keep only what
// the local UI can actually edit. `parseLocalTasks` owns the trust boundary
// (config values arrive as `unknown`), distinguishing "absent/corrupt" (→ empty
// list) from a single malformed entry (→ dropped, siblings kept).
