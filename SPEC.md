# Themia for WinUI: SPEC

Pins the behaviour this slice actually implements. Tags are `[S-NN]`, and where a rule is carried
over from the original Themia the tag number is kept the same so the two can be read side by side.

Mirror these tags in test names (e.g. `S09_clamps_a_widget_fully_on_screen`).

Owning files: `Themia.Core/Geometry/*`, `Themia.Core/Model/*`, `Themia.Core/Storage/*`,
`Themia.App/Shell/*`, `Themia.App/Interop/*`.

---

## Geometry model

- **[S-01]** A widget's position and size are stored as **fractions of its screen**: `x, y ∈ [0, 1]`
  is the top-left corner, `w, h ∈ (0, 1]` the size. `x`/`w` are fractions of screen **width**,
  `y`/`h` of screen **height** — independent axes, so aspect distortion across screens is accepted,
  not corrected.
- **[S-02]** Geometry is resolution-independent: the same layout opened on a larger screen renders
  every widget proportionally larger in both position and size. No stored pixel geometry, no stored
  grid.
- **[S-03]** The persisted document is `{ schemaVersion, views, activeViewId, monitorViews, design }`.
  A view is `{ id, name, widgets }`.

## Rendering

- **[S-04]** Each widget renders at `left = x·W`, `top = y·H`, inset on every side by
  `widgetGap / 2`, so neighbours show a gap without changing their logical rect. Logical edges are
  rounded to a shared whole-pixel boundary *before* the gap inset, so adjacent widgets still meet
  exactly.
- **[S-05]** The DIP space a fraction resolves into is the window's **real client rect divided by
  the window's real rasterization scale** — not `ActualWidth`. Changing display scale resizes the
  content without changing the client's pixel size, so no `SizeChanged` fires and `ActualWidth` can
  hold a stale pre-DPI value; trusting it rendered every widget 1.5x too far out on a 150% display.
- **[S-32]** A widget instance can drop its card: `WidgetSurface.Transparent` removes the fill and
  the border. `Translucent` keeps a tinted, partly see-through card. Neither is acrylic per widget —
  acrylic is a window backdrop, so per-widget acrylic would cost one window per widget.

## Grid snap aid

- **[S-06]** The grid is an **aid**, never storage. `design.gridSnap` (default on) rounds the rect
  chosen during drag, resize and placement to the nearest grid line. Holding **Alt** suspends it for
  the duration of the gesture. Storage is always the raw fraction.
- **[S-06a]** The cell overlay is drawn only in edit mode, and only when `gridSnap` is on.

## Constraints

- **[S-08]** Minimum widget size is a **pixel floor** (`MinWidgetPx`, 64 DIP), converted to a
  fractional floor at the moment of resize, so it means the same physical size on every monitor.
- **[S-09]** Widgets are clamped fully on-screen (`0 ≤ x`, `0 ≤ y`, `x + w ≤ 1`, `y + h ≤ 1`) for
  drag, resize, placement and load. Clamping is **total**: a non-finite or inverted rect collapses to
  a valid one rather than propagating NaN into storage.
- **[S-31]** Edit mode draws **eight** handles: four corners and four sides. A corner drags one edge
  on each axis; a side handle drags **only its own edge**, leaving the opposite edge and the whole
  other axis untouched. An edge dragged past its opposite stops at the [S-08] floor instead of
  inverting the rect.

## Defaults & placement

- **[S-10]** A widget definition declares its default size in **pixels**. At placement that is
  converted to a fraction of the current screen, so a newly dropped widget has a consistent physical
  size on any monitor, and scales per [S-02] thereafter.
- **[S-11]** Placement centres the widget on the drop point, then snaps ([S-06]) and clamps ([S-09]).

## Views & displays

- **[S-12]** Views are switched as a whole. Each holds its own widget list. The last view cannot be
  deleted — a desktop with no view has nowhere to put a widget.
- **[S-13]** The per-widget settings dialog edits a **clone** and writes back only on confirm, so
  Cancel really cancels. It does not mirror the live config into local state and sync it back.
- **[S-18]** `monitorViews` maps a display's device name to a view id; a display with no entry shows
  the active view. An entry pointing at a deleted view is dropped at load, not resolved.

## Window layering

- **[S-20]** Outside edit mode the widget surface carries `WS_EX_NOACTIVATE | WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW` and
  sits at the bottom of the z-order: clicking a widget neither focuses it nor raises it over the
  user's work, and it never appears in the taskbar or Alt-Tab.
- **[S-21]** The surface is clipped with `SetWindowRgn` to the union of the widget rects, so every
  click that is not on a widget lands on the desktop underneath. The region is rebuilt on every
  layout pass and is in **physical** pixels (DIP × rasterization scale).
- **[S-22]** Edit mode lifts `WS_EX_NOACTIVATE`, drops the region, and brings the surface to front
  **without** making it topmost. Topmost would park it above the windows it opens itself — the
  settings window and the widget picker both appeared behind the full-screen surface.
- **[S-23]** The window is placed with `AppWindow.MoveAndResize` using the monitor's **physical**
  work area. Display scale only applies inside the window, where XAML lays out in DIPs ([S-05]).

## Ticking

- **[S-24]** Every widget shares **one** timer. Its cadence is the finest any subscriber asked for;
  it drops to once a minute when nothing needs seconds, and stops entirely when nothing is
  subscribed or the surface is hidden.
- **[S-25]** Each wake is re-aligned to the next real boundary plus a small bias, rather than using a
  repeating timer. Waking exactly on the boundary rounds down about half the time, showing the
  previous second for a whole tick; a late wake must not push the schedule permanently off.
- **[S-26]** A subscriber fires when its period index changes, so a once-a-minute widget sharing a
  one-second timer still only runs on the minute.

## Persistence

- **[S-40]** Writes are **atomic**: serialise to a sibling temp file, then move over the target, so a
  crash mid-write cannot leave a truncated document.
- **[S-41]** There is a **single writer**, and saves are coalesced — a drag that mutates geometry
  sixty times a second produces one write.
- **[S-42]** `FlushAsync` takes the write gate *before* reading the pending snapshot, so a flush that
  finds nothing queued still waits for an in-flight write to land. Reading the snapshot first let a
  shutdown flush return while a debounced save was mid-write, i.e. "flushed" without durability.
- **[S-43]** Load distinguishes **absent** from **corrupt**. A missing file is a fresh profile. A
  file that is empty, unparseable, or from a newer `schemaVersion` is corrupt: defaults are returned,
  loudly, and the original is **moved aside, never deleted**.
- **[S-44]** A loaded document is repaired back inside its invariants rather than rejected — dangling
  ids, duplicate ids, config that does not match its widget kind, out-of-range design values and
  off-screen geometry are all fixed, and every repair is reported.
- **[S-45]** Closed sets are enums, not strings (`WidgetKind`, `WidgetSurface`, `AppTheme`,
  `ClockFace`). Widget config is a discriminated union with the discriminator written into the JSON,
  so a config can never be silently read as the wrong widget's shape. An unknown widget kind is
  dropped with a report, because this build cannot render it at all.

## Clock

- **[S-50]** 24-hour time is zero-padded; 12-hour time is not, and carries AM/PM. Midnight and noon
  read as **12**, not 0.
- **[S-51]** Hands sweep rather than step: the hour hand advances with the minutes, the minute hand
  with the seconds.
- **[S-52]** A clock without seconds (and with a digital face) asks for a **1-minute** cadence. An
  analog face always needs seconds, because its second hand sweeps.
- **[S-53]** An unknown or malformed time-zone id degrades to the local zone rather than throwing —
  this runs on every tick.
- **[S-54]** Formatting is done explicitly, not with culture patterns: the app builds with
  `InvariantGlobalization`, so culture format strings would not honour the config.

## Failure rules

- **[S-60]** No Win32 callback may let a managed exception unwind into native code. The tray
  `WndProc` and the monitor enumeration callback each wrap their whole body and fall through.
- **[S-61]** Every GDI handle is freed on all paths. `SetWindowRgn` takes ownership of the region on
  success, so the handle is deleted only while still owned and on every failure path.
- **[S-62]** No error is silent. Every catch either handles, logs, or is annotated with why ignoring
  it is correct.
- **[S-63]** One failing display, widget or tick subscriber must not cost the user the others:
  surface creation, tick dispatch and log sinks all isolate per-item failures.
- **[S-64]** The tray icon is re-added on the shell's `TaskbarCreated` broadcast, so an explorer
  restart does not permanently remove the only way in and out of edit mode.
